# HomeKit Integration

## Overview

This integration exposes HomeKit-friendly entities for camera, doorbell, and door/gate control. The doorbell tile lives **on the camera accessory** in HomeKit — you must link the doorbell binary sensor to the camera in the HomeKit bridge YAML.

- **Camera path** — the camera is `MjpegCamera`-based, so HomeKit gets a clean MJPEG live view without ffmpeg or HLS
- **Relay-based path** — door relays are exposed as switches and gate relays as covers
- **Legacy no-relay path** — the fallback lock entity still uses door/gate semantics for HomeKit mapping
- **Doorbell path** — the doorbell sensor must be linked to the camera via YAML

## Doorbell linking (required for HomeKit)

```yaml
homekit:
  - name: 2N Intercom Doorbell
    port: 21065
    filter:
      include_entities:
        - camera.2n_intercom_camera
    entity_config:
      camera.2n_intercom_camera:
        linked_doorbell_sensor: binary_sensor.2n_intercom_doorbell
```

**Rules:**
- Do **not** add the `binary_sensor.*_doorbell` to the HomeKit filter
- Do **not** include the camera or doorbell in any other HomeKit bridge
- HomeKit bridge configuration is YAML-only; it cannot be set from the UI
- Restart Home Assistant and re-add the bridge in the Home app after changing this YAML

## How it works

### 1. Configuration flow

When setting up the integration, users go through the multi-step flow:

- **Connection** — host, port, protocol, username, password, SSL verification
- **Device** — name, camera, doorbell, relay count, optional ringing peer
- **Relay** — per-relay door/gate type, relay number, pulse duration

The integration also supports **reauth** (auto-triggered on credential failure) and **reconfigure** (HA 2024.10+) flows for changing connection details without removing the entry.

### 2. Relay type and legacy lock mapping

Relay-based installs store door/gate behaviour per configured relay — door relays surface as switches, gate relays as covers. When no relays are configured the integration falls back to a single legacy lock entity whose `device_class` is set from the same door/gate option, so existing pre-1.0 setups still get a correctly-typed HomeKit accessory.

### 3. HomeKit entity mapping

Home Assistant's HomeKit bridge uses the entity's class to pick an accessory type:

| HA entity | HomeKit accessory |
|---|---|
| `camera.<intercom>_camera` (linked to doorbell sensor) | **Video Doorbell** — the doorbell tile lives here, not on the binary sensor |
| `switch.<intercom>_<door_relay>` | Switch (or Lock, depending on bridge filter) |
| `cover.<intercom>_<gate_relay>` | **Garage Door Opener** — open/close states |
| `lock.<intercom>_lock` (legacy fallback) | Lock when `device_class=None`; Garage Door Opener when `device_class="gate"` |

The doorbell binary sensor itself uses `BinarySensorDeviceClass.OCCUPANCY`. HomeKit's "programmable doorbell" service is provided exclusively by the linked-camera-accessory pattern above — the binary sensor's own class is irrelevant for the HomeKit tile.

### 4. Real cached state for status entities

`binary_sensor.<intercom>_input_1` and `binary_sensor.<intercom>_relay_1_active` are derived from the device's `io/status` and `switch/status` endpoints. They reflect real device state, not optimistic switching, which keeps HomeKit and HA in sync after manual relay activations from the 2N keypad or web UI.

## User experience

### Setup flow

1. User adds the **2N Intercom** integration
2. Enters connection settings — credentials are validated against `system/info`
3. Configures device options: camera, doorbell, relay count, optional ringing peer
4. Configures relay type and pulse duration per relay
5. Integration creates camera, doorbell, status sensors, relay entities, or the legacy lock entity when no relays are configured

### Changing settings later

- **Connection / credentials** → Reconfigure flow (host, port, protocol, credentials, SSL)
- **Device features or relay settings** → Options flow ("Configure" button on the integration card)
- **Credential rejection** → Reauth flow auto-triggered with a notification

### HomeKit integration

Once the integration is set up and the HomeKit bridge is configured in HA:

1. The camera is included in the HomeKit bridge and linked to the doorbell sensor via YAML
2. The relevant relay entities (or the legacy lock entity) are included in the HomeKit bridge
3. The device appears in the Home app with the correct accessory type
4. iOS/macOS users can control the door / gate
5. Siri commands work (e.g. "Hey Siri, open the front door")

## Technical details

### HomeKit declaration

`manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "domain": "2n_intercom",
  "homekit": {}
}
```

This tells HA the integration is HomeKit-compatible.

### Doorbell device class

`binary_sensor.<intercom>_doorbell` uses `BinarySensorDeviceClass.OCCUPANCY` because the underlying signal is "someone is at the door". The HomeKit programmable doorbell tile is created by linking this binary sensor to the camera (`linked_doorbell_sensor`), not by changing its device class.

### Camera transport

The camera is built on `homeassistant.components.mjpeg.MjpegCamera`. Credentials are passed via the `username` and `password` constructor kwargs and **never** appear in the URL. `stream_source()` only returns an RTSP URL when the device has the RTSP licence — for the typical IP Verso baseline, MJPEG is served natively to HomeKit and HA dashboards alike, with no ffmpeg in the loop.

### Services available to automations

| Service | Use case |
|---|---|
| `2n_intercom.answer_call` | Answer the active call |
| `2n_intercom.hangup_call` | Hang up the active or a specific session, with optional reason |

These pair naturally with HomeKit / mobile actionable notifications: tap "Open door" → fire the relay → call `2n_intercom.hangup_call` with the `active_session_id` to end the call cleanly.

## Translations

The legacy door/gate terminology is translated in both English and Czech.

| EN | CS |
|---|---|
| Door | Dveře |
| Gate | Vrata |
| Door (momentary switch) | Dveře (momentální spínač) |
| Gate (garage door opener) | Vrata (garážová vrata) |

## Example relay configurations

### Door relay → switch in HomeKit

```yaml
relay_name: "Front Door"
relay_device_type: "door"
relay_pulse_duration: 2000
```

### Gate relay → garage door opener in HomeKit

```yaml
relay_name: "Driveway Gate"
relay_device_type: "gate"
relay_pulse_duration: 15000
```
